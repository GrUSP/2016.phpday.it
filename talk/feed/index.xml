				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This talk is intermediate level and should have a bit of something for everyone whether you’re building a standard pipeline (non-docker) or already have a pipeline and looking to see how docker will make it even stronger.</p>
<p>I will demonstrate how building pipelines with Docker differs from traditional pipelines, what steps are involved in migrating from traditional pipelines to docker ones. I will share my experiences, tips &amp; tricks, lessons learned on my journey into docker land.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PHP7 is the new generation of the php engine which is dramatically faster than 5.6 and significantly reduces memory consumption. But is it ready for production? Our answer is yes! We started planning our migration in advance and were one of the first companies of our scale to deploy PHP7 to our 1000+ servers which run more then 2M lines of php code.</p>
<p>During the talk we will be discussing the process of switching over to PHP7 in detail, explaining what difficulties we encountered, how we dealt with them, and what the final results were. We hope this talk will inspire you to join us in «powered by php7» club.</p>
